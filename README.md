# Webpack-template
Thank's to Jack Coder (https://github.com/vedees/webpack-template).
Here's his Youtube channel about Webpack: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkCrmfIT6LBQWN02hNj6r1daz7965GxsV
and site: https://tocode.ru/curses/nastroika-webpack4/

I'm simply new for Webpack, learn from that resources, and created this repo based on the course of Jack Coder.
